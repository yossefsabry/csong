Supported Languages (UTF-8)

This app accepts UTF-8 text and renders it in the terminal. What you see depends
on your terminal and font. The list below reflects the languages/scripts the app
handles with explicit support, plus common scripts that render well in typical
monospace fonts.

Explicit RTL support (BiDi reordering + optional Arabic shaping)
- Arabic
- Hebrew
- Persian (Farsi)
- Urdu
- Kurdish (Sorani)
- Pashto

Wide-character (CJK) handling
- Chinese (Simplified, Traditional)
- Japanese
- Korean

Common LTR scripts (UTF-8, no special shaping needed)
- Latin-based languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, etc.)
- Cyrillic-based languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, etc.)
- Greek

Notes
- Any language encoded in UTF-8 can be displayed if your terminal font supports
  the glyphs.
- Complex shaping scripts beyond Arabic (e.g., Indic/Thai) depend on your
  terminal's shaping capabilities and may not render correctly.
